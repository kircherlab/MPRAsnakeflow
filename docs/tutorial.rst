Tutorial
=====================

We created Jupyter notebooks to help you get familiar with the workflow and understand the different steps without struggling to create your own configuration or use your own data. The notebooks are available in the repository `kircherlab/MPRAsnakeflow_tutorial <https://github.com/kircherlab/MPRAsnakeflow_tutorial>`_. You can run them locally on your laptop/desktop or within Google Colab.
