Getting started
=====================

We highly recommend as first start the MPRAsnakeflow :ref:`Tutorial` or the :ref:`Assignment example` and :ref:`Count example` examples. Here we provide a quick overview what you need to start the workflow.

MPRAsnakeflow exoists of two subworkflows, :ref:`Assignment` and :ref:`Experiment`. This quickstart shows the configuration for both and you have to leave out the respective part for if you only want to run one of them.

1. **Experiment workflow only:** Create an :code:`experiment.csv` in the format below, including the header. 
   `DNA_BC_F` or `RNA_BC_F` is the name of the gzipped fastq of the forward read of the DNA or RNA from the defined condition and replicate.
   `DNA_UMI` or `RNA_UMI` is the corresponding index read with UMIs (excluding sample barcodes), and 
   `DNA_BC_R` or `RNA_BC_R` of the reverse read.
   
   Multiple fastq files can be used for each column by separating them with :code:`;`.

   Right now a UMI has to be used. If you want to use MPRAsnakeflow without a UMI please switch to MPRAflow or contact us.

   Here is an example of an :code:`experiment.csv` file and it can be downloaded :download:`experiment.csv <../resources/example_experiment.csv>`:

  .. csv-table:: experiment.csv
    :file: ../resources/example_experiment.csv
    :widths: 5, 2, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25
    :header-rows: 1

2. **Experiment workflow only:** If you would like each designed sequence to be coloured based on different user-specified categories, such as `positive control`, `negative control`, `shuffled control`, and `putative enhancer`. To assess the overall quality, you can create a ``label.tsv`` in the format below that maps the name to the category as shown here:

  .. code-block:: text

     oligo_name_1 label1
     oligo_name_2 label1
     oligo_name_3 label2

  The `oligo_name_X` must exactly match the `header` in the design FASTA file.

3. Set up the config file

The config file is the heart of MPRAsnakflow. Here different runs can be configured. We recommend using one config file per MPRA experiment or MPRA project. But in theory, many different experiments can be configured in only one file. It is divided into :code:`global` (general settings), :code:`assignments` (assigment workflow), and :code:`experiments` (count workflow including variants).

See :ref:`Config` for more details about the config file. Here is an example running only the count experiments and using a provided assignment file.

.. include:: ../config/example_config.yaml
   :code: yaml

4. Run MPRAsnakeflow

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda activate snakemake
     snakemake --software-deployment-method conda --configfile config/example_config.yaml -p --cores 4

  .. note:: This will run in local mode using 4 cores. Please submit this command to your cluster's queue if you would like to run a highly parallelized version.

  Be sure that the files, :code:`experiment.csv` and the :code:`example_config.yaml` are correct. All fastq files for the count/experiment part must be in the same folder given by the :code:`data_folder` option. Please specify your barcode length and umi-length (if available) with :code:`bc_length` and :code:`umi_length`.

  The assignment files generated by the workflow, are named: :code:`assignment_barcodes.<config>.tsv.gz` and can be found in the :code:`results/assignment/<assignment>/` folder.

  The count files generated by the experiment workflow, are named: :code:`<condition>_<replicate>_merged_assigned_counts.tsv.gz` and can be found in the :code:`results/experiments/<project>/assigned_counts/<assignment>/<config>/` folder.
