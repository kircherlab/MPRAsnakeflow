**Welcome!**

MPRAsnakeflow pipeline processes sequencing data from Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs)
to create count tables for candidate sequences tested in the experiment.

MPRAsnakeflow is built on top of `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/>`_ (version 8 preferred) and is configured via a ``.yaml`` file.

-------------
Quick Example
-------------

To run MPRAsnakeflow, first activate the snakemake 8 environment with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate snakemake


And then run the main workflow with:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --software-deployment-method conda --cores $N --configfile config/example_config.yaml


--------
Features
--------

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``--software-deployment-method``
     - When ``conda`` is set, the utility uses mamba to efficiently query repositories and query package dependencies. MPRAsnakeflow also can use containers via apptainer by using ``--software-deployment-method apptainer``. Recommended option: ``--software-deployment-method conda apptainer``
   * - ``--cores``
     - This utility sets the number of cores (``$N``) to be used by MPRAsnakeflow.
   * - ``--configfile``
     - This file (e.g., ``config/example_config.yaml``) contains the project, its objects and properties, and sub-properties and its objects that **must** be set before running MPRAsnakeflow.


-------------------
Investigate results
-------------------

Th ebest option to investiate your results is to have a look at the QC report.

(In development) After successful execution, you can create a self-contained interactive HTML report with all results via:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --report report.html --configfile conf/example_config.yaml


This report can be forwarded to your collaborators.
An example of a generated report (using some trivial test data) can be seen `here <https://snakemake.github.io/resources/report.html>`_.
